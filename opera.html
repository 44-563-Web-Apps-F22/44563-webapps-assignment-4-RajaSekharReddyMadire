    <h3>Iolanthe</h3>
    <h5>SCENE.—An Arcadian Landscape.  A river runs around the back of the
        stage.  A rustic bridge crosses the river.</h5>
    <pre> (Enter Fairies) 

         CHORUS.     Tripping hither, tripping thither,Nobody knows why or whither 
                     We must dance and we must sing Round about our fairy ring!
         SOLO—CELIA. We are dainty little fairies,Ever singing, ever dancing.
         CHORUS.     No, we haven't any notion!Tripping hither, etc.
         SOLO—LEILA. If you ask us how we live,Lovers all essentials give—We can ride on lovers' sighs,
                     Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes.
         CHORUS.     Yes, we live on lover!Tripping hither, etc.
         CELIA.      Ah, it's all very well, but since our Queen banished Iolanthe, fairy revels have not been 
                     what they were!
         LEILA.      Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland.  Why, she wrote all our 
                     songs and arranged all our dances!
         FLETA.      To think that five-and-twenty years have elapsed since
                     she was banished!
         LEILA.      Something awful!  She married a mortal!
         FLETA.      Oh!  Is it injudicious to marry a mortal?
         LEILA.      Injudicious?  It strikes at the root of the whole
                     fairy system! 

                                (INVOCATION—QUEEN.)
                                     Iolanthe!
                    From thy dark exile thou art summoned!
                          Come to our call—
                          Come, come, Iolanthe!
                    
         CELIA.                   Iolanthe!                    
         LEILA.                   Iolanthe!                    
         ALL.           Come to our call, Iolanthe!   
         QUEEN.    For a dark sin against our fairy laws
                   We sent thee into life-long banishment;
                   But mercy holds her sway within our hearts—Rise—thou art pardoned!
                   
                                SONG—STREPHON.

                   Good morrow, good mother!
                        Good mother, good morrow!
                   By some means or other,
                        Pray banish your sorrow!
                             With joy beyond telling
                             My bosom is swelling,
                             So join in a measure
                             Expressive of pleasure,
                   For I'm to be married to-day—to-day—
                        Yes, I'm to be married to-day!
  
    CHORUS (aside).     Yes, he's to be married to-day—to-day—
                        Yes, he's to be married to-day!
    IOL.            Then the Lord Chancellor has at last given his consent
                     to your marriage with his beautiful ward, Phyllis?
    STREPH.     Not he, indeed.  To all my tearful prayers he answers
                me, "A shepherd lad is no fit helpmate for a Ward of Chancery."
